1. semantic.css

semantic.css is a copy of the shiny.semantic CDN_PATH when an app is created with the desired theme (this is a copy of semantic.flatly.css)

this is then renamed semantic.css and is then configured.

2. semantic.js
is copied from ../Semantic-UI-230/

3. components and themes are copied from ../Semantic-UI-230/
to avoid Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not found)

4. script options(shiny.custom.semantic = "styles/", shiny.minified = FALSE)

At top of script options needs to be set to shiny.custom.semantic = "styles/" (set it to NULL again to use default)
for shiny.semantic not to use their CDP_PATH and instead looks in the "styles/" folder on the server. 

shiny.minified needs to be false 
for the app to look for minified css. Probably should minify for production.
